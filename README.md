HOW TO LAUNCH THE PROJECT
1. We open the /server folder and opening a terminal in it, we can do so by pressing left mouse button on the folder in vs code and pressing open integrated terminal,this will open up a terminal in the /server folder
Afterwards if everything isn't installed we run the first command only once "npm install" (If launching the project the 2nd time we skip this step)
Then we run the command "npm run server" this will start the server which will load all of our json database data

2.We repeat the same steps for the /client folder as mentioned in step 1

We now have 2 options to choose from

First option
Launching the project in development stage, we can do so by running the command "npm start"
Second option
Lauching the project for production, we can do so by running the command "npm run build"
